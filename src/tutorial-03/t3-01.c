// Write a program that requests two integer values and then,
// calls functions (by defining function prototypes and function definitions)
// to find the following:

// the sum of two numbers,
// the larger of two numbers,
// the difference of two numbers,
// the product of the two numbers,
// the quotient from the division of the two numbers (with the larger number as the dividend and the smaller number as the divisor)
// the remainder from the division of the two numbers (with the larger number as the dividend and the smaller number as the divisor)
// the  average of the two number.
// The program then prints all these values.
